# neopixelSWD
Software driver for controlling NeoPixels in ChibiOS. Tested on STM32F407.

Used in a university project with a miniature car, where we had one 8 pixel strip in the front and another in the rear, with each pixel corresponding to a light such as brake light etc.

Let me know if you get this working on other boards or if you can provide insight into my timing assumptions discussed in the source files.
